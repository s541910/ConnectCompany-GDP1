# RFP - Connect Company

## Statement of Purpose :

To achieve our goals and priorities, it is very important to schedule and manage our available time carefully. Our flexible Scheduling platform allows the user to:

1.Schedule different types of events, appointments, etc in an easy way.

2.Admin and Client users will be able to create, edit, delete and view different events.

3.Admin will be able to view and also manage the user activity.

4.Can set the remainders to their scheduled appointments.
## Vision
We would like to create a WA that can be used on browsers like chrome, safariâ€¦., etc. The application would encourage users to interact with the companies directly and can get updates on the events happening in the specific company.

The user should have a valid username and password to enter into the system and also get notifications about the updates on subscribed channels. How the application will works

1.Each organization will be registered in the portal and they can post events happening in their company like an interview, Tech talks, or any updates on the company.

2.Users can open and subscribe to the company events or companies listed in the portal.

3.User can submit their request to join in the upcoming events.

4.They can get updates and emails on the subscribed events.

After subscribing to the event,

The user should be able to see a list of events happening and subscribed by him to return to the starting location (show on a map?) The website is cooperative, not complex to find the company and subscribe to the events happening.
